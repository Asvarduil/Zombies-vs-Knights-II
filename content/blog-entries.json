		<p>This is the first week that I'm keeping track of the development of <b>Zombies vs. Knights II</b>.  
		For the past few weeks, I've been working on a very basic prototype of the game, basically just getting 
		things off of the ground, and improved from the predecessor game (which was horrible, don't play it.)</p>
		<p>I also used this blog entry to work on the webpage.  This is my first independently-written webpage in
		Angular.js, so I needed some practice.  I also got a means of importing site content from an external file,
		so that I'm not directly writing text into the page.</p>"
