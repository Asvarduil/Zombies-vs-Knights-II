For the past few weeks, I've been working on a very basic prototype of the game, basically just getting things off of the ground, and improved from the predecessor game (which was horrible, don't play it.)</p><p>I also used this blog entry to work on the webpage.  This is my first independently-written webpage in Angular.js, so I needed some practice.  I also got a means of importing site content from an external file to work, so that I'm not directly writing text into the page.  I could've done things the same way as in the page for The Hero's Journey, but that's boring.</p>"
